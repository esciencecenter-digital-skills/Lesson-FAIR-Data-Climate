## What is access to data?

Accessibility addresses the *A* in the FAIR principles. Once the user finds the required data, she/he needs to know how can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation. Accessible data objects can be obtained by humans and machines upon appropriate authorisation and through a well-defined and universally implementable protocol. In other words, anyone with a computer and an internet connection should be able to access at least the metadata.

> ## This is what [go-FAIR.org](https://go-fair.org/principles) has to say about Accessible
> - A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol
> - A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
> - A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary
> - A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
{: .checklist}

> ## Accessible does not mean open without constraint
> Accessibility means that the human or machine is provided - through metadata - with the precise conditions by which the data are accessible and that the mechanisms and technical protocols for data access are implemented such that the data and/or metadata can be accessed and used at scale, by machines, across the web.

## Access to climate data

Although FAIRness in climate science is advancing and some clearly accessible repositories exist, it is still also common practice to only make a dataset accessible via the project website. Because projects do not last for ever, some of these websites are not maintained, resulting in inaccessible datasets.

Next to large-scale general-use repositories such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), there are also several domain-specific repositories. You may be familiar with [ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov/), [CDS](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu), or [Climate4Impact](https://climate4impact.eu).

> ## Stages of accessibility
>
> You submitted a paper, and the reviewer asks you to make your data accessible. You consider your options,
>
> 1. You make a note in your paper that data can be requested by sending you an email
> 2. You provide the data as supplementary information to your paper
> 3. You upload the data to some cloud storage and put a shareable link in your paper
> 4. You upload the data to a university drive and request a DOI from the library
> 5. You upload the data to a generic repository such as zenodo
> 6. You upload the data to a domain-specific repository such as [Hydroshare](https://www.hydroshare.org/)
>
> Describe which of these are adhering to the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), focusing on the findability and accessibility criteria.

> ## Data repositories where you can share your research data
>
> Many institutions and organisations have data repositories, where we can
> publish or preserve our reaserch data. We need to think about _if_ and _how_
> and _where_ we want to share our data. Let's examine a couple of different
> data repositories such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/),
> [ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov/), [CDS](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu).
> Answer the following questions for the repository (maybe datasets in the
> repository) that you selected:
>
> - Is this repository publicly accessible?
> - Is it free?
> - Is it proprietary?
> - Does it allow for authentication?
> - Is there any quality control for this repository?
> - Are metadata accessible, even if the data is not?
> - How long will the data be maintained?
> - Is there any backup system in place?
> - Is it easy to find data that is stored in this repository?
> - Is it easy to download data from this repository?
> - Is it easy to upload data to this repository?
